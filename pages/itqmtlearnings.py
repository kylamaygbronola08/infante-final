        Throughout this semester, I have worked hard to learn about quantitative methods. 
        I have used Google Colab to code and analyze data, which has helped me become very good at working with numbers.
        I have also practiced predicting what might happen in different situations by looking at data sets. 
        This has given me the skills to solve complex problems that involve data. I am now confident that I can use these skills to help solve real-world problems.
